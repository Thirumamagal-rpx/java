What is a cursor in stored procedure?

To handle a result set inside a stored procedure, you use a cursor. A cursor allows you to iterate a set of rows returned by a query and process each row accordingly. 

The set of rows the cursor holds is referred to as the active set.


Implicit Cursors:

automatically created by Oracle .

Whenever a DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) is issued, an implicit cursor is associated with this statement. 

always has attributes such as %FOUND== affected one or more rows or a SELECT INTO statement

 %ISOPEN==Always returns FALSE for implicit cursors, because Oracle closes the SQL cursor automatically after executing its associated SQL statement.

 %NOTFOUND== It returns TRUE if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement affected no rows, or a SELECT INTO statement returned no rows. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

 and %ROWCOUNT==Returns the number of rows affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or returned by a SELECT INTO statement.


Explicit cursors:

programmer-defined cursors . 

An explicit cursor should be defined in the declaration section of the PL/SQL Block.

It is created on a SELECT Statement which returns more than one row.

Read only: you cannot update data in the underlying table through the cursor.
