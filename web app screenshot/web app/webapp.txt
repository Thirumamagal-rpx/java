. A specific set of communication rules is called a protocol. 

TCP(Transmission Commission Protocol)creates a connection between the source and destination node and keeps it live until the communication is active. TCP breaks large data into smaller packets and also ensures that the data integrity is intact once it is reassembled at the destination node.

Firewalls can block ports and programs that try to gain unauthorized access to your computer. proxy servers basically hide your internal network from the Internet.
